### Description

RateCollegeClubs is a web application that provides college students with club ratings based on student feedback. Alike to RateMyProfessor or RateMyDorm, students can find honest reviews to find the perfect fit for them. This was created solely by Connor Chen during the summer of 2021 using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.
